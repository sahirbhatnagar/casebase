This explains how to run the mkdocs

1. Create a .Rmd in the docs folder. The .Rmd should have this at the top:

---
title: "data"
author: "Sahir"
date: "January 22, 2017"
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown
---

see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/markdown_document_format.html for different variants

For .Rmd documents with LaTeX in it (e.g. simulations.Rmd), I used
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown

For everything else I used

output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown_github



2. click on knit. this will make an .md document in the docs/ folder

3. Add the name of the page and the .md document to mkdocs.yml (which is located in the root folder)

From the root folder (the one that has the YAML file for the site)
mkdocs build
mkdocs gh-deploy

4. For mathjax:

first make sure you have root permissions on the python folder:

which python
python --version
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/python3.5

then install pthon markdown math extension:

pip install https://github.com/mitya57/python-markdown-math/archive/master.zip


add the folowing to the YAML file

extra_javascript:
    - http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML

markdown_extensions:
    - mdx_math


used knitr::kable(format = "html") for tables, but still had to manually remove backslashes on underscores in the .md file

also had to manually remove backslahes on exponents in the .md file
